  the Parlatype program, a basic audio player intended for speech transcription.
  The library is published separately as it might be useful for other applicatons
  as well.</para>
  
  <para>PtPlayer is the core GStreamer backend that can be used as an audio
  player. It uses internally PtWaveloader to extract the wave form from a given
  file. This data is boxed in a PtWavedata struct that can be passed to
  PtWaveslider, a GtkWidget showing the wave form.</para>
  
  <para>This is the first public release of Parlatype, it is still unstable and
  might change with the next minor release.</para>

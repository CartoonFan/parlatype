# What is it?

Parlatype is a minimal audio player for manual speech transcription, written for the GNOME desktop environment. It plays audio sources to transcribe them in your favourite text application.

 You can control the speed of playback, playing slowly as you type, playing fast for editing. The pitch is not altered, there is no “chipmunk” effect. Whenever you pause playback, it will rewind a few seconds, so that you can easier resume. Of course you can change how much it rewinds or whether it rewinds at all.

Parlatype can start on top of other windows. If you are working with a maximized text application, you can still see the Parlatype window.

Parlatype can be controlled with the “Play” button from your multimedia keyboard. This way it doesn’t have to have focus to control it. You can type in your text application and still have some (basic) control over Parlatype.

A powerful feature of Parlatype is a set of LibreOffice helpers (macros). For example you can insert a time stamp into your document with a shortcut of your choice. If you put the cursor on such a time stamp and use another shortcut, Parlatype will jump to that position.


# What it’s not

Parlatype is just an audio player, you still need another program, where you write your transcription to, e.g. LibreOffice. It doesn’t work with videos or streaming media. It’s not a tool for scientific transcription, rather for your personal use. There is no speech recognition, you have to type yourself.

Parlatype is a minimal audio player for manual speech transcription, written for the GNOME desktop environment. It plays audio sources to transcribe them in your favourite text application.

The idea and initial design of Parlatype is based on Frederik Elwertâ€™s program *transcribe*.

The display of the audio wave form started with code from *Buzztrax*.

The icon is based on work from the GNOME team.

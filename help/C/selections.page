<title>Selections</title>

<p>You can select a piece of the waveform with the mouse. Next time you press <gui>Play</gui>, it will play the selection only. When it is finished and you press <gui>Play</gui> again, it will loop the selection once.</p>

<note><p>When in selection mode, you can not exit the selection anymore until you deselect it.</p></note>

<p>Selections can be made with the mouse (or pointer device) with a left click, holding the mouse button and dragging the pointer. If you click with <key>Shift</key> key pressed, an already existing selection will be enlarged to that point.</p>

<p>To deselect click once with the left button into the waveform. If the waveform has keyboard focus, you can press <key>Escape</key>.</p>

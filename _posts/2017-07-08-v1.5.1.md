## Note on upgrading from previous versions
In this version the application ID was changed and the old application ID might still be lingering around on your disk. As a result you may have two desktop starters named "Parlatype". In that case please delete `/usr/share/applications/org.gnome.parlatype.desktop`. You can also delete `/usr/share/appdata/org.gnome.parlatype.appdata.xml`. Your preferences were stored under the old application ID, with the new one you have the default preferences again. Sorry for the inconvenience!

## Note for packagers
If your package keeps track of installed files, the following files were renamed in this release:
```
/usr/share/appdata/org.gnome.parlatype.appdata.xml
/usr/share/applications/org.gnome.parlatype.desktop
/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/org.gnome.parlatype.gschema.xml
```
Their new names are:
```
/usr/share/appdata/com.github.gkarsay.parlatype.appdata.xml
/usr/share/applications/com.github.gkarsay.parlatype.desktop
/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/com.github.gkarsay.parlatype.gschema.xml
```
There is a new file:
```
/usr/share/appdata/com.github.gkarsay.parlatype.libreoffice-helpers.metainfo.xml
```
And the LibreOffice Helpers are now installed in
```
$(libdir)/libreoffice/share/Scripts/python/Parlatype.py
```

## Known bugs
* With Wayland, the option "Start on top" doesn't work at all and "Remember position" remembers only the window's size, not the position.

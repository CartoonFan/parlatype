This is a major release of Parlatype with new features.

## New features
* Waveform is loaded on-the-fly, there is no blocking progress dialog.
  This brings an API bump in libparlatype.
* Waveform can be changed continuously instead of in discrete steps.
* Application ID has been changed to org.parlatype.Parlatype and the
  homepage moved to https://www.parlatype.org.
* LibreOffice helpers (macros) have been split from the main repository
  and turned into a LibreOffice extension.
* New D-Bus method GetURI to get currently playing file's URI.
* Internal modularization (PtController objects control Parlatype).
* Event handling is more compatible with GTK 4.
* Parlatype builds on Windows, there is no feature parity though.
